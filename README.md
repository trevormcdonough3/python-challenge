Here we have the PyBank and PyPoll data, resources, and analysis data. I added comments throughout
the code to explain my thought process through it all. I was struggling to open the PyBank file 
on GitHub and just in case that was not just a problem on my side, I added all the specific files
from PyBank. I am sorry for being disorganized with my data, hopefully it is not too hard to find 
everything.
